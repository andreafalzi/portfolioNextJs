Here I have learn Java as programming language and how IT infostructures works. At this time I was not sure that was what I want to do in my life, I was more interested into repairing and modding computers. <br><strong><u>Work</u></strong><br>After graduating, I was hired as a computer technician and my job duties were to fix old computers and assemble new ones. In the same corporate group I switched to distribution and entertainment, where I worked with machines that interfaced with assembled computers. At the end of my career in that company I was transferred to the support branch as an IT-Supporter for external customers and internally helping with IT-infrastructure configurations. It was here that I met the frontend developer of the company who showed me his website and what he was building for the company and from that moment on that my journey began.',
